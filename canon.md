# Canon

Inspired by [David Cole](http://davidcole.me/), this is the beginnings of my personal canon; materials and media that have influenced my thinking and that I wish to refer back to regularly for guidance.

The intention is for this to be constantly edited, with sources coming and going as my interests change and I expose myself to more of other peopleâ€™s thinking.

# Writing

* [The Inferno of Independence](http://frankchimero.com/blog/the-inferno-of-independence/), by Frank Chimero

# Talks
