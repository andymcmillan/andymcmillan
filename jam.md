# Belfast Kickstarter Project Jam

Hi, I'm [Andy](http://goodonpaper.com/). I've been backing Kickstarter projects since 2010, as well as also launching and successfully funding two projects; [The Manual](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/goodonpaper/the-manual), a journal with a focus on the maturing discipline of web design, and [XOXO](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/waxpancake/xoxo-festival), an experimental festival celebrating independently produced art and technology.

Kickstarter recently announced a series of collaborative workshops in cities around the US dubbed "[Project Jams](http://www.kickstarter.com/events/projectjam)", to help people understand how Kickstarter works, and to help them set up their own projects. **I'd like to do the same in Belfast.**

Just like Kickstarter itself, this event is for absolutely everyone. Whether you're a designer, developer, photographer, illustrator, artist, film-maker, musician, performer, dancer, or whatever else, you're absolutely welcome to come along.

I'll be announcing a date, venue, and opening registration very soon. In the meantime, sign up with your email address and I'll let you know when it's going down.

Additionally, if you know someone who would be interested in attending, please help spread the word. Thank you.
