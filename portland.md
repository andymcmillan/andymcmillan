# Navigating Portland

![Map of Central Portland](http://f.cl.ly/items/1z2U1O3E1I2d3s301W0D/Screen%20Shot%202014-05-10%20at%2010.07.31-2.png "Map of Central Portland")

Central Portland is split into 4 quarters, divided down the middle by a street called Burnside (the pink line on the map), and divided up the middle by the Willamette River.

Portland works on the grid system, like most US cities. Streets that run North / South have names, and streets that run West / East have numbers.

On the west side, the street numbers get higher the further west of the river you go, and on the east side, the street numbers get higher the further east of the river you go.

## Giving your address

When you give an address, you’ll give the *cross-streets*, saying:

* which quarter of Portland you’re in (SW / SE / NW / NE)
* which named street you’re on
* which numbered street you’re on

The XOXO venue this year is on *SE Salmon & 8th*, which means:

* you’re in SE Portland
* on the named street called Salmon
* 8 blocks east of the river

## Neighbourhoods

*South East* is heavily residential, so neighbourhoods form around the main arterial routes. Subsequently, it’s got a lot of the best parts of Portland, most of the great bars and restaurants are in this part of town.

*South West* is considered “downtown” Portland. It’s mostly offices and government buildings, but there are a few good spots, and some of the best food trucks are in SW (because they cater to the lunch crowd). SW Portland also contains the majority of Portland’s hotels.

*North West* is split into a couple of neighbourhoods, “Old Town / Chinatown” (closer to the river) which is where a lot of the homeless shelters and rehabilitation clinics are, and “The Pearl” (further west of the river), which is where all the rich people live. There is basically nothing of note in NW Portland.

*North East* is really an extension of South East Portland, it’s very residential and the pockets of neighbourhoods produce a lot of great places to eat and drink.
