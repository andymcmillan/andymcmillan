# Bicycle For Sale

![Grey fixed gear Mission Bicycle](http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8150/7532127978_e46ce1e144_c.jpg "Grey fixed gear Mission Bicycle")

I’m selling my custom-built, single speed Mission Bicycle.

> Mission Bicycles are made of steel, weigh less than twenty pounds, and are built to last a lifetime. Each one is custom built, part by part, in San Francisco, California. 

This one was custom built to my specification, then never used (because I am an idiot).

## Specification

* 56cm Valencia frame in grey (clear coat with matt finish) 
* Bullhorn handlebar with Brooks leather grips (honey)
* IRD Technoglide headset
* Brooks B17 leather saddle (honey)
* Origin-8 standard crankset
* KMC Rustbuster chain
* MKS Sylvan Stream pedals (no toe cages / straps)
* Vittoria Randonneur puncture resistant city tires
* French Mavic rims, Formula hubs, and DT spokes (silver)

## Price
Originally purchased for $1,315. Never used, in excellent condition. Current accepting all reasonable offers.
