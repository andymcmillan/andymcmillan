![Grey fixed gear Mission Bicycle](http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8150/7532127978_e46ce1e144_c.jpg "Grey fixed gear Mission Bicycle")

> Mission Bicycles are made of steel, weigh less than twenty pounds, and are built to last a lifetime. Each one is custom built, part by part, in San Francisco, California. 

This one was custom built to my specification, delivered to Belfast, and never used (because I am an idiot).

## Specification

* 56cm Valencia frame in grey (clear coat with matt finish) 
* Bullhorn handlebar with Brooks leather grips (honey)
* IRD Technoglide headset
* Brooks B17 leather saddle (honey)
* Origin-8 standard crankset
* KMC Rustbuster chain
* MKS Sylvan Stream pedals (no toe cages / straps)
* Vittoria Randonneur puncture resistant city tires
* French Mavic rims, Formula hubs, and DT spokes (silver)

## Price

The bicycle is available for collection in Belfast, or alternatively can be shipped anywhere in the world at your request. All costs of postage and packaging are exclusive of the sale price.

## Â£650 (ono)
