# Hi, I’m Andy.

I  run a made-up company called [Fiction](http://fiction.co).

I publish [The Manual](http://alwaysreadthemanual.com), a semi-regular journal which explores the maturing discipline of web design. From 2009—2013, I organised an annual week-long festival in Belfast, Northern Ireland; [Build](http://buildconf.com), which had a similar focus.

I also co-organise [XOXO](http://xoxofest.com), a festival in Portland, Oregon, which celebrates independent artists who are using technology to make a living doing what they love, with my friend Andy Baio.

Additionally, I'm a co-founder of [Established Coffee](http://establishedcoffee.co), a speciality coffee shop in Belfast’s Cathedral Quarter, along with my good pal Mark Ashbridge.
