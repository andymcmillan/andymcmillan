# Hi, I’m Andy.

I’m publisher of [The Manual](http://alwaysreadthemanual.com), a journal on web design as a discipline. From 2009 - 2013, I organised an annual festival in Belfast, Northern Ireland; [Build](http://buildconf.com), which had a similar focus.

I also co-organise [XOXO](http://xoxofest.com), an annual festival in Portland, Oregon, which celebrates independent artists who are using technology to make a living doing what they love, with my friend [Andy Baio](http://waxy.org).

I also helped design and open [Established Coffee](http://establishedcoffee.co), a speciality coffee shop in Belfast’s Cathedral Quarter.
