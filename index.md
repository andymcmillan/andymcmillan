# Hi! I’m Andy. 

I’m a creative director, designer, and event producer based in Portland, Oregon.

I’m also one of the organizers of [XOXO](https://xoxofest.com), an experimental festival that celebrates independent artists who live and work on the internet.

I’m also the owner and co-founder of [Heck](https://heckbrewing.com), an independent non-alcoholic craft brewery based in Portland, Oregon.

I work with internet companies on their community and events strategy through my studio, [Regular](https://regular.events). We’ve produced festivals and conferences including Duolingo Duocon, Adobe 99U, Framer Loupe, and BackerKit Bond, and have consulted on projects for clients including Slack, Intel, Figma, and Ableton.

Previously, I was the owner of [Suckerpunch](https://suckerpunch.bar), Portland’s first zero-proof cocktail bar, I produced [Build](https://buildconf.com), a conference and week-long design festival for web designers in Belfast, Northern Ireland, and I published [The Manual](https://alwaysreadthemanual.com), a design journal for web designers.

You should follow me on [Mastodon](https://xoxo.zone/@andymcmillan), [Instagram](https://instagram.com/goodonpaper), and [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/andymcmillan/). I’m also on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/goodonpaper/).
