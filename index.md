# Hi, I'm Andy.

I'm an event producer based in Portland, Oregon.

I organize [XOXO](http://xoxofest.com), an experimental festival for independent artists who live and work online.

I'm also the proprietor of [Suckerpunch](http://suckerpunchpdx.com), a zero proof (non-alcoholic) bar, launching with a series of pop-up events later this year.

Previously, I ran [The Outpost](http://outpostpdx.com), a shared workspace for independent artists, published [The Manual](http://alwaysreadthemanual.com), a design journal for web designers, and organized [Build](http://buildconf.com), a design festival for web designers.

You can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/andymcmillan), [Instagram](https://instagram.com/goodonpaper), and [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/andymcmillan/). Want to get in touch? You can [send me an email](mailto:hi@andymcmillan.com).
