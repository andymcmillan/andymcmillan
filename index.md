# Hi, I’m Andy.

I’m a designer and event producer, and I live in Portland, Oregon.

I'm currently [working on a new platform for independent artists](https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/24/18019720/kickstarter-drip-xoxo-andy-baio-mcmillan) to share what they're working on, build community, and support their creative practice with ongoing financial support.

I also organize [XOXO](http://xoxofest.com), an experimental festival for independent artists who live and work online. 

Previously, I ran [a shared workspace for independent artists](http://outpostpdx.com), published [a design journal for web designers](http://buildconf.com), and organized [a design festival for web designers](http://themanual.org).

Want to get in touch? [Send me an email](mailto:hi@andymcmillan.com).
