# Hi, I'm Andy.

I'm a designer and event producer based in Portland, Oregon.

I'm currently [working on a new platform](https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/24/18019720/kickstarter-drip-xoxo-andy-baio-mcmillan) for discovering, following, and financially supporting the work of artists, creators, and creative organizations.

I also organize [XOXO](http://xoxofest.com/), an experimental festival for independent artists who live and work online.

Previously, I ran [The Outpost](http://outpostpdx.com/), a shared workspace for independent artists, published [The Manual](http://themanual.org/), a design journal for web designers, and organized [Build](http://buildconf.com/), a design festival for web designers.

Want to get in touch? [Send me an email](mailto:hi@andymcmillan.com).
