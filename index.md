# Hi, I’m Andy.

I’m the owner of [Suckerpunch](https://suckerpunch.bar), Portland's first zero-proof bar. We just announced our non-alcoholic brewery project, [Heck](https://heck.beer).

I’m also the co-founder of [XOXO](https://xoxofest.com), an experimental festival for independent artists who live and work online. I occasionally produce events for clients through my studio, [Regular](https://regular.events).

Previously, I produced [Build](https://buildconf.com), a festival for designers who work on the internet, and published [The Manual](https://alwaysreadthemanual.com), a journal for designers who work on the internet.

You can follow me on [Mastodon](https://xoxo.zone/@andymcmillan), [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/andymcmillan.bsky.social), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/goodonpaper/), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/goodonpaper/), and/or [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/andymcmillan/).
