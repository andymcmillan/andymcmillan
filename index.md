# Hi! I’m Andy. 

I’m a creative director, designer, and event producer based in Portland, Oregon.

I work with internet companies on their community and events strategy through my studio, [Regular](https://regular.events). We’ve produced festivals and conferences including Duolingo Duocon, Adobe 99U, Framer Loupe, and BackerKit Bond, and have consulted on a variety of projects for clients including Slack, Intel, Figma, and Ableton.

I’m also the owner and co-founder of [Heck](https://heck.beer), a dedicated craft non-alcoholic brewery based in Portland, Oregon. Previously I was running [Suckerpunch](https://suckerpunch.bar), a zero-proof cocktail bar pop-up.

I’m also one of the organizers of [XOXO](https://xoxofest.com), an experimental festival for independent artists who live and work online.

Previously I produced [Build](https://buildconf.com), a conference and design festival for web designers in Belfast, Northern Ireland, and published several issues of [The Manual](https://alwaysreadthemanual.com), a design journal for web designers.
