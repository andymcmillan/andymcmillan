# Hi, I’m Andy.

I publish [The Manual](http://themanual.org), a design journal for the web, and organize [XOXO](http://xoxofest.com), an experimental festival celebrating independently-produced art and technology in Portland, Oregon.

I’m still figuring out what to use this corner of the Internet for. I use other corners of the Internet to [share photos](http://instagram.com/goodonpaper), [listen to music](http://www.rdio.com/people/goodonpaper/), [keep a log of the movies I watch](http://letterboxd.com/andymcmillan/), and [track the delicious beer I drink](https://untappd.com/user/andymcmillan).

In the meantime, you can reach me via [email](mailto:andy@goodonpaper.com) or [Twitter](http://twitter.com/andymcmillan).
