# Hi, I’m Andy.

I organize [XOXO](http://xoxofest.com), an experimental festival for independent artists who work on the internet. 

I also manage a non-profit called [The Liberty Foundation](http://theliberty.foundation) which supports artists who work on the internet by giving them the tools they need to grow their practice into an independent business.

You’re welcome to [send me an email](mailto:hi@andymcmillan.com), or you can [follow my work on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/andymcmillan).
