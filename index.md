# Hi, I’m Andy. 

I’m one half of [XOXO](https://xoxofest.com), an experimental festival celebrating independent artists working online, and [The Outpost](https://outpostpdx.com), a shared workspace for the XOXO community.

Previously I published [The Manual](https://themanual.org), a design journal for the web, and organized [Build](http://buildconf.com/), which was a design festival for web designers.

You’re welcome to [send me an email](mailto:andy@goodonpaper.com), or [say hi on Twitter](https://twitter.com/andymcmillan).
