# Hi, my name is Andy.

I’m the owner of [Suckerpunch](https://suckerpunch.bar/), Portland's first dedicated zero-proof bar and bottle shop.

I’m also the co-founder of [XOXO](https://xoxofest.com/), an experimental festival for independent artists who live and work online. I occasionally produce events for clients through my studio, [Regular](https://regular.events/).

Previously, I produced [Build](https://buildconf.com/), a festival for designers who work on the internet, and published [The Manual](https://alwaysreadthemanual.com/), a journal for designers who work on the internet.

You can follow me on <a rel="me" href="https://xoxo.zone/@andymcmillan">Mastodon</a>, [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/goodonpaper/) and [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/andymcmillan/). Want to get in touch? You can [send me an email](mailto:hi@andymcmillan.com).
