# Hi, I'm Andy.

I'm an independent event producer living in Portland, Oregon. I organize [XOXO](http://xoxofest.com), an experimental festival for independent artists who live and work online. 

Previously, I ran [The Outpost](http://outpostpdx.com), a shared workspace for independent artists, organized [Build](http://buildconf.com), an annual festival for designers who work on the internet, and published [The Manual](http://themanual.org), a journal for designers who work on the internet.
