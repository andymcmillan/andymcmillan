# Hi, I'm Andy.

I'm a designer and event producer. I live in Portland, Oregon. 

Right now I'm working on [a new platform](https://www.kickstarter.com/blog/a-new-approach-to-our-work-on-drip) for independent artists to share their work, build community, and support their creative practice with ongoing financial support.

I also organize [XOXO](http://xoxofest.com), an experimental festival for independent artists who live and work online. 

Previously, I ran [The Outpost](http://outpostpdx.com), organized [Build](http://buildconf.com), and published [The Manual](http://themanual.org).

Want to get in touch? [Send me an email](mailto:hi@andymcmillan.com).
