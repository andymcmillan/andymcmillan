# Hi, I’m Andy.

I  run a made-up company called [Fiction](http://fiction.co).

I organise [Build](http://buildconf.com), a festival in Belfast, Northern Ireland; and publish [The Manual](http://alwaysreadthemanual.com), a journal; both of which focus around the discipline of web design and explore the why questions around our work as designers.

I also co-organise [XOXO](http://xoxofest.com), a festival in Portland, Oregon, which celebrates independent artists who are using technology to make a living doing what they love, with my friend Andy Baio.

I’m also a co-founder of [Established Coffee](http://establishedcoffee.co), a speciality coffee shop in Belfast’s Cathedral Quarter, along with my good pal Mark Ashbridge. (We’ll be opening late 2013.)
