# Hi, I'm Andy.

I'm a designer and event producer based in Portland, Oregon.

I also organize [XOXO](http://xoxofest.com), an experimental festival for independent artists who live and work online.

Previously, I ran [The Outpost](http://outpostpdx.com), a shared workspace for independent artists, published [The Manual](http://themanual.org), a design journal for web designers, and organized [Build](http://buildconf.com), a design festival for web designers.
