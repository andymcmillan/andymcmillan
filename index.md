# Hi, I’m Andy. 

I organize [XOXO](http://xoxofest.com "XOXO"), an experimental festival celebrating independent art and technology in Portland, Oregon. I also publish [The Manual](http://themanual.org "The Manual"), a design journal for the web. 

I like to help other people organize their events. You can [hire me](http://andymcmillan.is) to help you too.

I use other corners of the Internet to [share photos](http://instagram.com/goodonpaper), [listen to music](http://www.rdio.com/people/goodonpaper/), [keep a log of the movies I watch](http://letterboxd.com/andymcmillan), and [track all the delicious beer I drink](https://untappd.com/user/andymcmillan). 

You’re welcome to send me an [email](mailto:andy@goodonpaper.com), or say hi on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/andymcmillan).
