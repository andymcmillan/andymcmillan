# For Sale

I’m currently clearing out my apartment and my studio, and am selling off a few things I no longer need. You may also be interested to see [what I currently have listed on eBay](http://www.ebay.co.uk/usr/andygood).

Everything can be picked up from my apartment in South Belfast, and most of the smaller items can be shipped on request.

I had a beautiful single-speed bicycle custom built by Mission Bicycle in August 2012. It has sat in my studio, basically unused, since clearing customs. You can [check out the specification](http://goodonpaper.com/bicycle), or [email me](mailto:andy@goodonpaper.com) if you’re interested.
