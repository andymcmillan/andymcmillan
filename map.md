# Map of Portland and Vicinity

Hello, friends! 

Earlier this year, during a tour of the City of Portland Archives as part of Oregon Archives Month, I came across a beautiful, rarely exhibited map of Portland, produced by the American Map and Reproducing Company in 1912.

The map was produced shortly after the merging of East Portland, Albina and Portland in 1891, but before the street name standardization project of the early 1930’s — giving a unique snapshot of the city’s landscape during a period of great change.

The City of Portland Archives have been kind enough to furnish me with a high resolution scan of the original map, which I’m reproducing as a high quality, archive quality giclée print.

The map is 28”x40” 8-color, 1200 dpi giclée print, on 205gsm 100% cotton rag fine-art paper, printed by ColorHaus in SE Portland.

I’m offering this initially as a limited run for friends. As such, the prints are available at cost, for $50. Local collection preferred, please.

Thanks to Devin Busby and the team at the City of Portland Archives and Records Center for making the original map available for reproduction.
