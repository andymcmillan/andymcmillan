I’m printing a high quality reproduction of this beautiful map of Portland. Produced by the American Map and Reproducing Company in 1912, and titled “Map of Portland and Vicinity”.

<img src='http://d.pr/i/1erTB/5um8BEqq+'>

The map was produced well in advance of the city’s standardization of street naming patterns, and shows neighborhood/addition names, railroads, street car lines, parks and meadows, rivers, creeks, lakes, within the city limits.

The map is 28”x40”, printed on [paper stock details] by ColorHaus in SE Portland. Available as a limited pre-order for $50. Collection only.
